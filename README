= QtWebKit benchmarks =

== What ==

These benchmarks will test loading speed and drawing speed of single
pages. Real webcontent will be used to do these tests.

== How ==

We have some copies of real world websites. These can be served with

a fake server. This is requiring the following changes to
    /etc/hosts:

You can use the create_hosts.sh IP script to create entries
based on your mirrored content.

== Tests ==

=== Loading ===

Load webpages and wait for the completion. The time it takes to
load all of them will be printed.

=== Painting ===

Painting will load the page and then paint.

=== Scrolling ===

Scroll the content...

=== Robustness ===

Open a webpage, pick a random link, load it, do that forever. This
will provoke failures in QtWebKit we can attempt to analyze.

== Tools ==

=== Mirror ===

Mirror a given webpage into a sqlite database. This can be used to
implement a page loading test on top of these static data.

=== http server ===

Serve a sqlite3 database with content

=== launcher ===

Simple fullscreen application.
