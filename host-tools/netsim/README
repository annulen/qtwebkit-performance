== What ==
Simulate network latency and packet loss on Linux.

== How is it done? ==
It is using the netfilter userspace API to add latency
and drop every N-th package of the link. This is based
on the libnetfilter_queue userspace application with added
code for latency and packet loss handling.

== How to compile? ==
To compile you will need to have the libnetfilter_queue
headers installed and then issue qmake of Qt4 in the netsim
directory.

== How to setup? ==
You will need to create a netfilter rule using iptables..

   iptables -I INPUT -o lo -j NFQUEUE

This simple rule will insert a rule to the INPUT chain for
all packets going on lo and will send them to the NFQUEUE
target. Now packets on localhost can be handled by the
test program.

== How to run? ==
You will need root/NET_CAP privileges and then can issue a:

    ./netsim --mode=umts

For more help please see ./netsim --help
